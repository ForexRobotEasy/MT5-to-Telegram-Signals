# Forex Robot Easy - MT5 to Telegram Signals

This is a code snippet that demonstrates how to integrate a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading algorithm with the Telegram messaging platform. The code allows the user to receive real-time trading signals and updates directly to their Telegram account.

## Product Description

Forex Robot Easy presents the MT5 to Telegram Signals, a powerful tool that streamlines your forex trading experience. By connecting your MT5 trading algorithm with Telegram, you can receive instant notifications, order updates, and even chart screenshots directly to your Telegram account.

With MT5 to Telegram Signals, you can stay connected to your trading activities no matter where you are. Whether you are at your computer or on the go, you will never miss an important trade opportunity or update again.

## How It Works

The code snippet provided here serves as a sample implementation of the MT5 to Telegram Signals integration. It includes the necessary libraries and functions to establish a connection between your MT5 trading algorithm and the Telegram API.

Here is a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The code includes the necessary Telegram library and defines the required variables.
2. The `SendTelegramMessage` function is responsible for sending messages and chart screenshots to Telegram.
3. The `OnOrderEvent` function is called whenever there is an order event, such as opening, modifying, or closing an order. It filters the events based on the specified symbol and magic number.
4. The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the program. It sets the bot token, chat ID, symbol and magic number filters, and connects to the Telegram API.
5. The `OnDeinit` function is called when the program is about to be terminated. It disconnects from the Telegram API.
6. The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the program. It starts the trading algorithm, places an example order, modifies it, and closes it. It also demonstrates how to use the `SendTelegramMessage` function to send messages and screenshots to Telegram.
